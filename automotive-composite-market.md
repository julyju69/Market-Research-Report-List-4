<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive composites are materials used in vehicles that combine two or more distinct components to create a stronger and lighter material. Thermoset composites are created by combining a resin with a reinforcement material that is then cured into a hard and rigid form. On the other hand, thermoplastic composites are made from polymers that can be melted and reshaped multiple times. Both types of composites offer advantages in terms of strength, weight reduction, and design flexibility, making them popular choices in the automotive industry for various applications.</p></p>
