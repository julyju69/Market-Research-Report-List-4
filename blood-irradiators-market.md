<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Irradiators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-ray Blood Irradiation</li><li>Gamma-ray Blood Irradiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blood irradiators are medical devices used to treat blood products with ionizing radiation to prevent the proliferation of harmful pathogens. There are two main types of blood irradiation methods - X-ray blood irradiation and gamma-ray blood irradiation. X-ray blood irradiation uses electromagnetic radiation to kill pathogens in blood products, while gamma-ray blood irradiation uses high-energy photons. Both methods are effective in sterilizing blood products and ensuring their safety for transfusion, but gamma-ray irradiation is more commonly used due to its deeper penetration and stronger sterilization capabilities.</p></p>
