<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Wireless Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic Smoke Alarm</li><li>Photoelectric Smoke Alarm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ionic smoke alarms use a small amount of radioactive material to ionize the air, making it sensitive to smoke particles. They are more responsive to flaming fires but can be prone to false alarms from steam or cooking. Photoelectric smoke alarms use a light sensor to detect smoke particles. They are more effective at detecting smoldering fires but may be slower to respond to flaming fires. Both types of alarms are essential components of smart wireless smoke detector systems, providing different types of fire detection capabilities.</p></p>
