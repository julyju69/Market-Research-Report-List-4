<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Static Wind Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam</li><li>Reflective</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Static Wind Meters are commonly divided into two market types: Through-beam and Reflective. Through-beam wind meters use a transmitter and receiver placed at a distance from each other to measure wind speed and direction by detecting interruptions in the airflow. Reflective wind meters, on the other hand, use a single unit that emits and detects signals reflected by objects in the wind, providing accurate measurements without the need for separate transmitter and receiver units. Both types are effective in various applications, catering to different user preferences.</p></p>
