<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three phase Circuit Breaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset</li><li>Automatic Reset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Three phase circuit breakers are classified into two main types based on the reset mechanism: manual reset and automatic reset. Manual reset circuit breakers require manual intervention to reset the breaker after it has tripped due to an overload or short circuit. On the other hand, automatic reset circuit breakers reset themselves automatically after tripping without the need for any manual intervention. Both types serve the same purpose of protecting electrical circuits from damage and ensuring safety.</p></p>
