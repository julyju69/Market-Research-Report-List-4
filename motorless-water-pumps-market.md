<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorless Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive-displacement motorless water pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of liquid inside a cavity and then forcing it out through a discharge port. This type of pump is ideal for applications requiring high pressure and low flow rates, such as agricultural irrigation systems. On the other hand, centrifugal motorless water pumps use impeller rotation to transfer water through the pump, making them more suitable for applications requiring high flow rates and moderate pressure, such as swimming pool circulation systems. Both types of pumps offer efficient and reliable water transfer solutions.</p></p>
