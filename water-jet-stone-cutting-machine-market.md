<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-jet Stone Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Water-jet</li><li>Pure Water-jet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water-jet stone cutting machine market is divided into two main types: abrasive water-jet and pure water-jet. Abrasive water-jet machines use a mixture of water and abrasive particles to cut hard materials like stone, while pure water-jet machines use only water for softer materials. The abrasive water-jet market is more suitable for cutting tough materials requiring higher cutting power, while the pure water-jet market is ideal for cutting softer materials with precision and without heat-affected zones. Both types cater to different cutting requirements in the stone industry.</p></p>
