<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof-mounted</li><li>Floor-mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central inverters are the main component of a solar power system, converting the DC electricity generated by solar panels into usable AC electricity. There are two main types of central inverters commonly used in solar installations: roof-mounted and floor-mounted. Roof-mounted inverters are typically smaller in size and are mounted directly on the roof near the solar panels. Floor-mounted inverters, on the other hand, are larger and are installed on the ground near the solar array. Both types of inverters play a crucial role in maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of solar power systems.</p></p>
