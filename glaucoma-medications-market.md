<p><strong>The Glaucoma Medications Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-angle Glaucoma</li><li>Closed-angle Glaucoma</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma medications are used to treat both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma, two common types of the disease. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form, where the fluid in the eye does not drain properly, causing pressure to build up. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the iris blocks the drainage angle in the eye, leading to a rapid increase in eye pressure. Medications for both types of glaucoma help to reduce intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve.</p></p>
