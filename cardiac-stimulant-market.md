<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Stimulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Glycosides</li><li>Non-Cardiac Glycosides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac stimulants are medications that help increase the strength and efficiency of the heart muscle. There are two main types of cardiac stimulants: Cardiac Glycosides and Non-Cardiac Glycosides. Cardiac glycosides, such as Digoxin, work by directly affecting the heart muscle to improve its pumping ability. Non-cardiac glycosides, like Dobutamine, work by increasing the heart's contractility without directly affecting the heart muscle. Both types of cardiac stimulants are crucial in the treatment of various heart conditions and play a vital role in improving cardiac function.</p></p>
