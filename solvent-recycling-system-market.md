<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Recycling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Processing</li><li>Continuous Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent Recycling System market includes two main types: Batch Processing and Continuous Processing. Batch Processing involves recycling solvents in batches, where a fixed amount of solvent is processed at once. This method is suitable for smaller operations or when different types of solvents need to be processed separately. Continuous Processing, on the other hand, involves a continuous flow of solvents through the recycling system. This method is more efficient for larger operations and ensures a continuous supply of recycled solvent.</p></p>
