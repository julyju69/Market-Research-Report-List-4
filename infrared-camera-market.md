<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled infrared detectors</li><li>Uncooled infrared detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The infrared camera market can be divided into two main types based on the type of detectors used: cooled infrared detectors and uncooled infrared detectors. Cooled infrared detectors require cooling mechanisms to maintain a constant temperature for optimal performance, while uncooled infrared detectors do not require such cooling mechanisms. Cooled detectors generally offer higher sensitivity and resolution but are more expensive and require more maintenance, while uncooled detectors are more cost-effective and easier to operate but may have lower performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution.</p></p>
